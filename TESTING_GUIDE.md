# Testing Guide for Responsive Recipe Finder

## Quick Start Testing

### 1. Start the Backend Server
```bash
cd server
npm start
```
The server will run on `http://localhost:5000`

### 2. Start the Frontend Client
```bash
cd client
npm start
```
The client will run on `http://localhost:3000`

### 3. Test Responsive Design

#### Option A: Using Browser DevTools (Quick Testing)
1. Open `http://localhost:3000` in Chrome or Firefox
2. Press `F12` to open Developer Tools
3. Click the **Toggle Device Toolbar** icon (📱) or press `Ctrl+Shift+M` (Windows) / `Cmd+Shift+M` (Mac)
4. Test different device sizes:
   - iPhone SE (375px)
   - iPhone 12/13 Pro (390px)
   - iPad (768px)
   - iPad Pro (1024px)

#### Option B: Using Real Devices (Recommended for Deployment)
1. Find your computer's IP address:
   - Windows: Run `ipconfig` in Command Prompt, look for IPv4 address
   - Mac/Linux: Run `ifconfig` in Terminal, look for inet address
2. Ensure phone is on the same WiFi network
3. On your phone's browser, visit: `http://[YOUR_IP_ADDRESS]:3000`
   - Example: `http://192.168.1.100:3000`

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Content overflowing horizontally
**Solution**: Check browser DevTools for elements with fixed widths. Ensure all containers have `max-width: 100%` and use `overflow: hidden` where needed.

### Issue: Text too small on mobile
**Solution**: Font sizes automatically scale down, but if too small, check the media queries in `style.css` and adjust accordingly.

### Issue: Buttons/inputs hard to tap
**Solution**: Ensure minimum touch target size of 44x44 pixels. Our implementation uses appropriate padding.

### Issue: Images not scaling
**Solution**: All images should have `width: 100%` and appropriate `max-height` or `object-fit: cover`.

## Browser Testing

Test the responsive design on:
- ✅ Chrome (Desktop & Mobile)

npm run dev

# Or start separately:
# Terminal 1 - Backend
cd server && npm start

# Terminal 2 - Frontend  
cd client && npm start

# Build for production
cd client && npm run build
```

## Reporting Issues

If you find any responsive issues:
1. Note the device/browser combination
